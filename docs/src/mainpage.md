# Terminal User Interface #

The terminal user interface ( **TUI** ) is a project to develop an alternative
to the aging Curses and Ncurses libraries. **TUI** is current developed in
_C++,_ and efforts are beign made to convert it to _C_ and _Python_. Reference
documentation is generated with Doxygen, and is available on the [GitHub
Pages](https://luxatrumstudio.github.io/TUI/).

Guides for how to use the **TUI** library can be found in the Tutorials tab of
the documentation.
